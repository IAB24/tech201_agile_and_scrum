## How does Agile benefit a business

1. Satisfied customers

By involving customers in the development process, Agile teams keep them in the loop and show that they value their opinion. Stakeholders want to be engaged throughout the project life cycle so they can offer feedback and ensure that the final product will be suited to their needs. These tailor-made deliverables will likely improve the overall user experience and boost customer retention.

2. Improved quality 

Agile methodologies use an iterative approach to project management, meaning processes are improved upon each time an interval is repeated. This consistent focus on improvement and quality control is one of the core principles of Agile, and it helps to create superior products.

3. Adaptability

The central theme of Agile is flexibility. Agile teams are responsive to change, even at the last minute, and can adapt to it without much disruption. Project deliverables are not set in stone, so teams can easily reassess their plans and adjust their priorities to align with updated goals. Being adaptable means teams can deliver consistently and manage clientsâ€™ changing requirements effectively.

4. Predictability 

Agile teams work in short time periods, sometimes referred to as sprints. These fixed durations (e.g., two weeks) make it easier for project managers to measure team performance and assign resources accordingly. It is also easier to predict costs for shorter time periods than for a long-term project, simplifying the estimation process. 

5. Reduced risk

Developers regularly assess progress during sprints, meaning they have better visibility into the project and can spot potential obstacles quickly. These minor issues can be tackled before they escalate, creating an effective risk mitigation process and giving the project a greater chance of success.

6. Better communication

Agile teams prioritize face-to-face communication and continuous interaction. They will usually conduct daily meetings to ensure everyone is on the same page and working towards the same objectives. By regularly communicating with each other, they eliminate potential confusion to successfully achieve their objectives.
